# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

INPUT                 = @abs_top_srcdir@/opm/ \
			@abs_top_srcdir@/tests/not-unit/blackoil/simpleSPE9/blackoil_sim_test.txt \
			@abs_top_srcdir@/tests/not-unit/blackoil/CO2/co2_sim_test.txt \

# see e.g. dune-grid for the examples of mainpage and modules
# INPUT                 += @srcdir@/mainpage #                          @srcdir@/modules

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.

# EXCLUDE               += @abs_top_srcdir@/dune/porsol/test

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or
# directories that contain example code fragments that are included (see
# the \include command).

EXAMPLE_PATH          += @abs_top_srcdir@/examples/ \
			@abs_top_srcdir@/tests/not-unit/blackoil/simpleSPE9 \ 		
			@abs_top_srcdir@/tests/not-unit/blackoil/CO2 \

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or
# directories that contain image that are included in the documentation (see
# the \image command).

IMAGE_PATH            += @abs_top_srcdir@/@doxy_dir@/Figure

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. The create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option.
# You can optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted
# DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as the name of the layout file.

LAYOUT_FILE            = @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@/@doxy_dir@/DoxygenLayout.xml

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify an additional
# user-defined cascading style sheet that is included after the standard
# style sheets created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule
# certain style aspects. This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET
# since it does not replace the standard style sheet and is therefor more
# robust against future updates. Doxygen will copy the style sheet file to
# the output directory.

HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@/@doxy_dir@/style.css
